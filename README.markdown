[BtcPoclbmWrapper - Bitcoin Poclbm C# Wrapper](https://github.com/Nucs/BtcPoclbmWrapper)
====================

The point of this project is to create a handful tool for developers who would like to interact with the popular bitcoin miner [Poclbm](https://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm) (by [m0mchil](https://github.com/m0mchil)) in C#.

Usage
-----------------
As part of the development, I target to simplify the use for poclbm with few simple methods to work with it.
- Start
- Stop
- GatherDevices - Collects the available mining devices that support OpenCL as a dictionary of their device Id and name.
