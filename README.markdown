[BtcPoclbmWrapper - Bitcoin Poclbm C# Wrapper](https://github.com/Nucs/BtcPoclbmWrapper)
----------------------

The point of this project is to create a handful tool for developers who would like to interact with the popular bitcoin miner [Poclbm](https://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm) (by [m0mchil](https://github.com/m0mchil)) in C#.

This project is currently developed on .net-4.5.1-RC, but it can be downgraded as I believe atleast to .net-3.0 .

---------------------
Please note that the mining pool creditals that are in the IdleMiner project example may be in use at any time by someone else which leads to "Failed to subscribe" MinerCrashed event.
To get your own creditals please visit: http://mining.bitcoin.cz/ and create a new worker.
