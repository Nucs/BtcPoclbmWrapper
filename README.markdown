[BtcPoclbmWrapper - Bitcoin Poclbm C# Wrapper](https://github.com/Nucs/BtcPoclbmWrapper)
----------------------

The point of this project is to create a handful tool for developers who would like to interact with the popular bitcoin miner [Poclbm](https://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm) (by [m0mchil](https://github.com/m0mchil)) in C#.

This project is currently developed on .Net Framework 4.5.1 RC, but it can be downgraded I believe atleast to .net3.0 .
